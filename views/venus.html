                The second planet from the sun, Venus is Earth's twin in size. Radar images beneath its atmosphere reveal that
                its surface has various mountains and volcanoes. But beyond that, the two planets couldn't be more different. Because 
                of its thick, toxic atmosphere that's made of sulfuric acid clouds, Venus is an extreme example of the greenhouse effect. 
                It's scorching-hot, even hotter than Mercury. The average temperature on Venus' surface is 900 F (465 C). At 92 bar,
                the pressure at the surface would crush and kill you. And oddly, Venus spins slowly from east to west, the opposite 
                direction of most of the other planets.

                The Greeks believed Venus was two different objects â€” one in the morning sky and another in the evening. Because it is 
                often brighter than any other object in the sky, Venus has generated many UFO reports.
