                Zipping around the sun in only 88 days, Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, and it's also the smallest,
                only a little bit larger than Earth's moon. Because its so close to the sun (about two-fifths the distance between
                Earth and the sun), Mercury experiences dramatic changes in its day and night temperatures: Day temperatures can
                reach a scorching 840  F (450 C), which is hot enough to melt lead. Meanwhile on the night side, temperatures drop
                to minus 290 F (minus 180 C).

                Mercury has a very thin atmosphere of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium and can't break-up incoming 
                meteors, so its surface is pockmarked with craters, just like the moon. Over its four-year mission, NASA's MESSENGER 
                spacecraft revealed incredible new discoveries that challenged astronomers' expectations. Among those findings was 
                the discovery of water ice and frozen organic compounds at Mercury's north pole and that volcanism played a major 
                role in shaping the planet's surface.
